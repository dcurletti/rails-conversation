Conversations:

I attempted to model this exercise off of iMessage.  The basic concept being that every message sent to another user, or group of users, creates a new conversation.  In doing so, there is no needed to differentiate between a private message or a group message, all messages are private (between two parties) until either of the participants invites a new user.  

When wanting to create a group conversation, the user would merely have to intput multiple numbers/usernames and the controller would create a new conversation entry, as well as entries in the ConversationParticipant table for each of the invited members, that way they would have access to it.
